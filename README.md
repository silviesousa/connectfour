Connect Four

A personal interpretation of Connect Four, the vertical checkers game. Players take turns dropping their pieces into one of seven columns that have six rows of slots. The first player to get their pieces into four slots that are vertically, horizontally, or diagonally contiguous wins the game.

This game was written using Javascript, HTML, CSS and jQuery.
